Part of the [RforLunch](https://Rfun.library.duke.edu/) workshop series, this workshop focusses on the {[duckplyr} package](https://duckplyr.tidyverse.org/).

> duckplyr package will run all of your existing dplyr code with identical results, using [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)
> where possible to compute the results faster. In addition, you can
> analyze larger-than-memory datasets straight from files on your disk or
> from the web.
